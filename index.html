                            grade, at the end of the year, we all had to make our own pillows and design the covers. If you don't, I don't care, keep reading. I remember back then, I tried to be edgy and deep so I wrote the cheesy ass quote, "good friends
                            are like stars, you don 't always see them but you know they're there ". I haven't seen the pillow in forever and don't even know where it is but as I was thinking of what to write for you, the quote just popped up in my head.
                            It's funny because I hate cheesy generic bs but I feel like this quote really encapsulates our relationship.</p1>

                            without growing apart or feeling weird gives me faith in the future our friendship. It gives me something to hang on to and something to look forwards to. When I'm successful and you're a broke ass bitch in the streets, just
                            know I'm someone you can hit up. Know I love you and think of this message as something we can both laugh at and think of fondly together 40 years in the future. Happy birthday ceebs :)
